 100 Days Of Code - Log
 
 ***Day 1: April 05, 2017***

**Today's Progress**: Finished 15 hours worth of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap & jQuery tutorials and challenges, coded until 3 am. My dog died on Monday, and when I am sad I either stop working or work way way too much. I guess at least I was productive?

**Thoughts**: I've been afraid of CSS and Bootstrap in the past (I realize now it was only because I didn't have deep enough understanding of it) but now I feel so good and confident!

 ***Day 2: April 06, 2017***

**Today's Progress**: Spent ~4hrs mob programming our personal project - a rails wedding organizer app! We got some good understanding of how to add custom fields to a Devise user model.

**Thoughts**: Theres no compiled documentation on this, surprisingly. New project idea...!

 ***Day 3: April 07, 2017***

**Today's Progress**: Another monrning of mob programming. The three of us completed testing for the previous days features (both feature and unit tests), and then proceeded to add and test an entire new feature! two stories complete.

**Thoughts**: I'm starting to wish we could devote more hours to this RoR mob programming project. I am thoroughly enjoying it.

 ***Day 4: April 08, 2017***

**Today's Progress**: I spent several hours working on the JavaScirpt section of the Front End Certification course on freeCodeCamp. Today was interesting - I learned about switch cases and did some practice excercises on the topic. 

**Thoughts**: I learned something new! We were never taught about this at the bootcamp so I get really excited when I learn something new [computer science related lol].

**Today's Progress**: I completed the JavaScirpt section of the Front End Certification course on freeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts**: I really enjoyed it - I feel like I learned a lot about Data structures. And I finally actually understood JSON!! It feels great.

***Day 6: April 10, 2017***

**Today's Progress**: We spent another morning mob programming features and tests for our secret wedding app. Today we learned about seed data, in order to hard code instances of certain objects.

**Thoughts**: I loved learning it! Learned many other new rake db: commands! We were (and still are) stuck on how to load seed data into specific rspec files for a long long time. It got me quite frsutrated, especially because we ran out of time todeal with itfor today, so it's on hold until our next session. Well, anyway...
