 100 Days Of Code - Log
 
 Day 1: April 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished 10 hours worth of HTML, CSS & Bootstrap tutorials and challenges in 4 hours. Nice refresher!

**Thoughts**: I've been afraid of CSS and Bootstrap in the past (I realize now it was only because I didn't have deep enough understanding of it) but now I feel so good and confident!

 Day 2: April 06, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent ~4hrs mob programming our personal project - a rails wedding organizer app! We got some good understanding of how to add custom fields to a Devise user model.

**Thoughts**: Theres no compiled documentation on this, surprisingly. New project idea...!
